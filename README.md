# Python Concurrency

Welcome to Python Concurrency!

## Introduction

Explore Python concurrency in two approaches:

1. **Multithreading**: Ideal for I/O-bound tasks, enforces concurrent execution.

2. **Multiprocessing**: Best for CPU-bound tasks, enables true parallelism.

Both need synchronization tools to prevent race conditions.

I've also explored asynchronous programming to eliminate GIL-related issues.

## Project Overview

Create a Python program combining I/O and CPU tasks.

Take an incremental approach, starting single-threaded, and refactoring for parallelism.
