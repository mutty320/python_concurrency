# Python Concurrency

Welcome to Python Concurrency!

## Introduction

Explore Python concurrency in two approaches:

1. **Multithreading**: Ideal for I/O-bound tasks, enforces concurrent execution.

2. **Multiprocessing**: Best for CPU-bound tasks, enables true parallelism.

Both need synchronization tools to prevent race conditions.

I've also explored asynchronous programming to eliminate GIL-related issues.

## Project Overview

Combine I/O and CPU tasks for an enhanced concurrency experience.

- v1: Initial program structure.
- v2: Multithreading enhances download speed.
- v3: Synchronization tools introduced.
- v4: Semaphore usage for controlled downloads.
- v5: Multiprocessing for image resizing, better performance.
- v6: Multithreading for downloads, multiprocessing for resizing.
- v7: Utilize IPC and manual process management with multiprocessing queues.
